This is a Clinic Management System for Bora Clinic.

#Problem Addressed
Bora clinic was established in the year 2005 and is located in Kilifi county, Gongoni ward by the
government of Kenya. Its mandate include child immunization, family planning, lab test,
outpatient consultation and pharmaceutical services. The facility handles up to two hundred
outpatients in a day.
Due to the large number of patients growing, Bora clinic is struggling to keep up with the pace. A
lot of file misplacement and time wastage and inefficiencies in operations are becoming rampant.
This is largely due to the use of patient’s cards and physical files.
For this reason, Bora clinic is looking to improve its system in order to increase its efficiency and
quality of health care service to its patients.

#Proposed Solution
The proposed system will address the challenges faced by Bora clinic. It is designed to provide
different modules for various stakeholders e.g. nurses to input patient’s data and save it digitally
to a database. This will eliminate the need for handwritten file, which was prone to human errors.
It will also be easy to share files across different departments of the clinic and its stakeholders.
The system allows for a generation of patient ID, which can be printed into a card. The patient
only has to carry the ID card to identify himself/herself in the different departments in the clinic
.This creates easy retrieval of patients data also backing up data is simplified. The system also
captures the user check in and check out time in order to gauge the time spent looking for
medication in the clinic.

#System Modules
i. The receptionist; Responsible for checking in the patient, capturing patient data like
name, age, sex then assign the patient to a doctor and a patient ID.
ii. The doctor; Offers consultancy services to the patient and examines him/her then gives a
prescription to the patient.
iii. The chemist; Awards the prescribed drugs to the patient and the pricing of each drug.
iv. The Billing Officer; Bills the patient of all the drugs and services offered to the patient and
checks him/her out.
v. The system administrator; Responsible for adding and removing the users of the system
e.g. doctors, awarding privileges to the system users.
